# Capstone-Project

This project aims to identify the safest place to park your bike in Toronto, Canada. 
The report is targeting bikers of any kind, whether BMX, Electric, classic bicycles etc. to understand where they can drive and park safely. Moreover, this could also serve as a potential route planner for the bikers, to ensure they are driving at safe routes with limited risks of crime.
Data science is implemented to analyse the data and focus on safest neighbourhoods for biking. 

Based on the problem definition, the below factors will influence the final decision point:
-	finding safest area of Toronto based on Bicycle Thefts statsics as recorded by Toronto State Police
-	Choosing the safest area/neighbourhood
